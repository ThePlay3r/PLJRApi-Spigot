# PLJRApi
Spigot plugin created to make development of other plugins as easy and efficient as possible for me.

----
## BungeeCord Support
- If you want to have full BungeeCord support, please drag-n-drop [PLJRApi-Bungee](https://github.com/ThePlay3r/PLJRApi-Bungee/releases/latest) to your BungeeCord's plugin folder.
